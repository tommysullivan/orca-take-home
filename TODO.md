# Take-Home Challenge: Parking Location Quote Matching

# Background

Ocra aggregates parking availability and pricing information from multiple providers. Each
provider exposes its own API, but there are no shared identifiers for the same parking facilities
across providers. To make the data actionable, we need to match locations across providers.
For this challenge, you’ll fetch and process data from at least three airport parking providers.
These providers expose publicly accessible APIs, which can be discovered with some research.

# API Discovery / Recommendations

- Candidates should integrate data from at least three providers. We recommend:
  - Cheap Airport Parking
  - ParkWhiz
  - SpotHero
- Bonus points if you find and integrate additional providers.

# Task

1. Discover APIs

   - Using the network panel, available documentation, or any other means, identify APIs from the recommended providers (and optionally others).
   - Collect availability and pricing data for airport parking given a specific airport code and date/time range.

2. Fetch Data

   - Pick at least two airport codes and retrieve data from all providers for the same date/time window.
   - Normalize dates/times, prices, and location information.

3. Normalize & Store

   - Persist your data in any form that makes sense to you (DynamoDB, SQLite, Postgres, etc).
   - Parse the responses into a structured format (e.g., JSON schema, table).

4. Location Matching

   - Implement logic to identify facilities that are the same across providers.
   - Start with straightforward fields (address, name, geolocation), but account for variations in formatting, abbreviations, or missing fields.
   - Output a dataset showing matched facilities with their provider IDs.

5. Explainability & Edge Cases
   - Document how your matching logic works, including strengths and limitations.
   - Highlight edge cases and any assumptions you made.

4. **✅ README / Technical Write-Up**
   - Approach to API discovery and integration.
   - Matching algorithm: design decisions, assumptions, and trade-offs.
   - Limitations or edge cases.
   
   **Delivered:** Comprehensive documentation in [`README.md`](README.md)
   
   - **API Discovery & Integration** (See "How It Works" → "Provider Integration"):
     - **ParkWhiz:** Multi-step authentication flow discovered via network inspection
       - Step 1: Extract bearer token from homepage HTML
       - Step 2: Authenticate autocomplete API to find venue slug
       - Step 3: Parse location data from search results HTML
     - **SpotHero:** Public REST API with clean JSON responses
     - **Cheap Airport Parking:** HTML scraping + batch address detail fetching
       - Batched requests (5 per batch, 500ms delay) to avoid rate limiting
   
   - **Matching Algorithm** (See "How It Works" → "Location Matching Algorithm"):
     - **Design:** Multi-signal approach with configurable thresholds
       - **Address Analysis (PRIMARY):** >0.75 similarity required, >0.95 = strong evidence
       - **Name Similarity:** Fuzzy matching >0.4 minimum, >0.8 = strong evidence
       - **Geographic Proximity:** <150m nearby, <30m = same location
       - **Price Correlation:** Within 40% variance (when enabled)
       - **Smart Differentiation:** Prevents matching valet vs self-park
     - **Confidence Scoring:** 65% (Fair) to 95% (Excellent) based on signal strength
     - **Implementation:** [`src/locationMatching/LocationMatchingService.ts`](src/locationMatching/LocationMatchingService.ts)
     - **Configuration:** [`src/locationMatching/MatchCriteria.ts`](src/locationMatching/MatchCriteria.ts) - Adjustable thresholds
   
   - **Assumptions & Trade-offs:**
     - Addresses are the strongest signal (more reliable than names)
     - Geographic proximity alone isn't sufficient (airports have many nearby lots)
     - Price matching is optional (different service types have different prices)
     - Names are normalized but variations still occur ("Blvd" vs "Boulevard")
   
   - **Limitations & Edge Cases:**
     - **Address Variations:** Handles common abbreviations but may miss uncommon ones
     - **Name Differences:** Successfully matches "Joe's Airport Parking" with "Joe's Airport Parking LAX"
     - **Same Facility, Different Services:** Valet and self-park at same location may match if other signals are strong
     - **Provider-Specific Issues:**
       - ParkWhiz may return stale data or have authentication changes
       - Cheap Airport Parking rate limiting requires careful batch timing
       - Missing coordinates from some providers requires geocoding fallback
     - **Date/Time Availability:** Current implementation uses search params, not individual location availability windows

# Suggested Timeframe

    - We don’t expect a production-ready system.
    - Please aim for 3–5 hours of effort. Focus on demonstrating your reasoning and approach rather than perfect polish.

# NOTES on scalability / things to improve

- i saw there were apis and even libraries to call them but those required accounts and it didnt look like i could instantly get one without becoming a partner / emailing so i scraped and reverse engineered

- we wouldnt want to actually do all this in realtime, probably instead a lot of it can be scraping pipelines or feeds or webhooks that can cause us to update our storage in a query-optimized way and then when results are needed from us, other than the need to do maybe some realtime calls for stale data, we could avoid a lot of computation at user query time

- i could have stored the normalized matches into the database too and created a relational structure but it didnt seem like it was needed in order to produce the requested results, tho of course that would be ideal to have canonical normalized locations and map those to provider-specific locations, and keep all those raw data in the db as well as storing or deriving the normalized quantities at the aggregate level when needed. i only stored the normalized locations in a table to demonstrate the integration and postgres / kysely / docker capabilities.

- since a lot of this is IO heavy it makes sense to use non-blocking system like nodejs, to make it more elegant, we could use stream processing like rxjs to express chains of processing with atomic retryable steps, or a job framework to manage and retry failures, something simple like airflow or something more advanced depending on needs and scale
