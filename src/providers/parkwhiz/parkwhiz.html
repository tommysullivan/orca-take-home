If we allege that you have infringed or threatened to infringe our intellectual property rights, then, in addition to any other rights and remedies we may have, we may seek any preliminary or permanent injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. You submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of Illinois and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.\r\n\r\n**Arbitration Clause:**\r\nYOU AGREE IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST PARKWHIZ WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER, OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY. HOWEVER, THIS CLAUSE WILL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS BROUGHT BY PARKWHIZ FOR YOUR VIOLATION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, VIOLATION OF THE NON-SOLICIT CLAUSE OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR VIOLATION OF THE COUPON ABUSE CLAUSE OF THIS AGREEMENT; IN WHICH CASE WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN A COURT WITH JURISDICTION.\r\n\r\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes ("AAA Rules") then in effect. The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law for the State of Illinois and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any dispute or claim arising out of, related to, or connected with the use of Services or Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim arose or it will be forever banned. Any arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. The payment of any filing and arbitration fees will be in accordance with AAA Rules.\r\n\r\nUnless you and ParkWhiz agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing between ParkWhiz and a Buyer will take place in the county of your billing address, and any arbitration hearing with a Seller or Developer will take place in the county in which you have your principal place of business. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearing will take place in the nearest available location for AAA arbitration. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted by all parties to the arbitrator, unless determined a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\r\nThe parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and formation of this clause. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available at court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claims. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. The arbitrator’s decision and judgment shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect.\r\nThis Arbitration Clause shall not apply to the following types of claims: 1) violation of ParkWhiz’s intellectual property rights; 2) violation of the Non-Solicit Clause of this Agreement; 3) violation of the Coupon Use Clause of this Agreement; and 4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of law.\r\n\r\n**Modification:**\r\nParkWhiz may at any time modify these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. If we make material changes we will notify you of such changes and provide you with the opportunity to review the modification. Your continued use of this Site will be conditioned upon the terms and conditions in force at the time of your use. If you do not agree with any of the changes or modifications your only recourse is to cease use of the Site and Services. \r\n\r\n**Miscellaneous:**\r\nThe above policies may be superseded by requirements or obligations imposed by statute, regulation, or legal process. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our usage agreement, please email us at legal@arrive.com.\r\n\r\n**Additional Terms and Conditions Specific to Users**\r\n\r\n**Booked Parking Usage:**\r\nUsers who book parking through the Site must present the parking pass in accordance with the instructions included with the booking to receive their reserved parking space on the day of reservation. You are solely responsible for ensuring that all information regarding your booking is correct including, if required, your license plate number, car make and model, and reservation time. ParkWhiz will not be liable to you if you enter any information incorrectly and you receive a ticket, a boot is placed on your vehicle, or your car is towed from the lot/garage as a result. If you do not present the parking pass to the Seller or the garage, you will not get credit for the online payment and the online payment will not be refunded at a later date. If you arrive early or stay past your parking time you will be charged the posted rates at the garage, and not the booked rate and you may not receive credit for your online payment, that is within the discretion of the garage. The parking booked is valid only for the times listed on the parking pass. You are responsible for ensuring that you arrive at the correct booked parking location. ParkWhiz is not liable for road closures or changing traffic conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is your responsibility to comply with any and all rules or regulations posted by garage operators. If a parking facility allows tailgating on its premises, it is your responsibility to comply and check any local city ordinance codes on what is permissible (e.g., no open flames, no cooking, etc.).\r\n\r\n**Resale of ParkWhiz parking passes is not permitted.**\r\nNote: If your account has been flagged as a Reseller Account and you have been notified of this action by ParkWhiz the following terms apply:\r\nAll bookings for parking reservations made after your account has been flagged will be non-refundable to the original form of payment and any general cancellation refunds will be issued as a credit to your ParkWhiz account only;\r\nYou will not be able to book daily or transient reservations of any kind; \r\nYou will be refunded to your original form of payment in the event of special circumstances such as but not limited to event cancellation, rescheduling, parking garage/operator requests, etc. \r\nParkWhiz reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account and any other alias accounts if it is determined that you continue to resell passes after the warnings of your prohibited action.\r\n\r\n**Drive Up Mobile Payments:**\r\nDrive Up Mobile Payments is an in-app feature that will allow you to pay for off-street parking at a gated parking garage by simply using your smart mobile device and the ParkWhiz App. In order to use this feature, you must have an account with us. This feature is used when you do not reserve parking at a specific location before arriving at the parking garage and you pull a ticket at the entrance; therefore only use this feature if you have not pre-booked parking using the ParkWhiz App. \r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n1.\tAt participating parking locations, drive up to the entrance gate and push the button to pull a ticket;\r\n2.\tPark your car in any open parking spot not marked reserved;\r\n3.\tOpen the ParkWhiz App and select Scan My Ticket;\r\n4.\tScan the ticket you pulled when you entered the garage by taking a picture in the App;\r\n5.\tSelect your form of payment and confirm purchase; \r\n6.\tGo about your day or enjoy your event;\r\n7.\tReturn to your car when you are ready;\r\n8.\tInsert your ticket at the exit gate of the garage; and\r\n9.\tReceive confirmation and receipt of payment. \r\n\r\nDrive Up Mobile Payments allows you to estimate your total for parking after you scan your ticket. All estimates are simply that, an estimate and are not guaranteed to the be the final cost of your parking transaction and are based on your estimated time of exit. The final cost of parking is charged to your selected method of payment upon your exit of the garage and is calculated based upon your entrance and exit times and the rates charged by the parking garage. By using this feature, you agree to your selected method of payment being charged upon your exit from the garage. All parking prices are set directly by the parking garage owner or operator, not ParkWhiz; therefore Drive Up Mobile Payments rates may differ from the drive-up rates posted at a location, if applicable. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-book parking before arriving at a garage and then pull a ticket upon arrival and scan your ticket into the app you may be charged twice for your parking transaction and you may not qualify for a refund if you do not cancel your pre-booked reservation before the start time. **Drive Up Mobile Payments transactions cannot be canceled by you or ParkWhiz**, once you scan your ticket into the ParkWhiz App the only way to complete a Drive Up Mobile Payments transaction is to successfully exit the garage and pay for the time your vehicle was parked. \r\n\r\n**Coupon Use:**\r\nYou are required to abide by all terms and conditions associated with ParkWhiz coupons and discounts. Accordingly, you may not post codes or distribute them in any other manner as all such codes are non-transferable and are generally intended only for one-time use. ParkWhiz, in its sole discretion, may suspend your account for violation of this term. Furthermore, any continued violations may result in the immediate termination of any and all of your accounts, without notice. ParkWhiz reserves the right to seek any and all legal remedies available to us, both at law and in equity; including, but not limited to, monetary damages or injunctive relief.\r\n\r\nIf you have a coupon that automatically applies to any booking on your account, it can only be used when you are signed in to that account and will not be applied to any bookings made under a guest account. Additionally, any credits you may receive, for any reason, can only be used when you are logged into your account and will not be transferred to another user’s account or booking made from a different account.\r\n\r\n**Cancellations and Refunds:**\r\nAny reservation is fully refundable up to the start of that reservation unless specifically noted otherwise. You can cancel your reservation at any time up to the start of your reservation. **After the start time of your reservation, all bookings become non-refundable, even if you are unable to park or have yet to park.**  It is within our sole discretion, provided the circumstances, to offer you an account credit if you attempt to cancel a reservation after the start time. If you are unable to park due to the lack of parking spaces for false information provided by a garage, it will be the responsibility of the garage operator to refund you for your reservation. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the circumstances surrounding postponed events are unpredictable. Although we will try to help you resolve your parking situation, we are not responsible for postponed events, partial performances, or venue, date, or time changes. No refunds will be issued.\r\n\r\n**Bulk Reservation Purchase Requests:** \r\nBy completing and submitting the Bulk Purchases Request you acknowledge and agree to be bound to these additional terms and conditions:\r\n1. ParkWhiz will be selecting and purchasing parking reservations on your behalf; \r\n2. You agree to allow ParkWhiz to charge your credit card that is on file on the date of the reservation; \r\n3. ParkWhiz will use its best efforts to accommodate your exact request as submitted; however, there is no guarantee that ParkWhiz will be able to fulfill your request as made; \r\n4. When fulfilling a Bulk Reservation Request, ParkWhiz will default to select a parking facility that is closest to your requested destination; \r\n5. ParkWhiz will use its best efforts to minimize all costs associated with the reservation and charged to your credit card; \r\n6. You understand that requests may be fulfilled at multiple parking facilities based on varying factors including but not limited to: \r\n    a. The number of parking spaces you need to be reserved; \r\n    b. The destination; \r\n    c. The size of the parking facilities; and \r\n    d. The availability of parking space; \r\n7. You also understand that all parking spaces may not be next to each other within any given facility and that only spaces are being reserved not a location within the facility; \r\n8. ParkWhiz will contact you should any issues arise in fulfilling your request; and \r\n9. Once a request is fulfilled it is your sole responsibility to contact ParkWhiz should any changes or cancellations need to be made. \r\n\r\n**Additional Terms and Conditions Specific to Sellers**\r\n\r\n**Order of Precedence:** \r\nIn the event that a Seller has entered into a separate written Seller Agreement with ParkWhiz and such Seller Agreement includes terms or conditions that conflict with the terms and conditions in this Part III, the terms and conditions of the Seller Agreement shall govern.\r\n\r\n**Non-Solicit:** \r\nEach party shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, during the term of the Agreement and for two (2) years after the termination of the Agreement, directly or indirectly, on your own behalf or on the behalf of a third party, solicit or employ any employee of the other party or its affiliates without written consent of the other party; provided that, neither party shall be precluded from hiring any person who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement not targeted specifically at employees of the other party or its affiliates.\r\n\r\nYou agree that violation of this section will result in irreparable harm to ParkWhiz and that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate ParkWhiz for such violation. Thus, ParkWhiz shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including but not limited to specific performance or injunctive relief to enforce this section. ParkWhiz reserves the right to seek any and all other remedies available at law or in equity for a violation of this section.\r\n\r\n**Seller Console:**\r\nSubject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, ParkWhiz hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use the Seller Console and the information ParkWhiz provides or makes available to you in connection therewith, solely for internal business purposes. You will not and will not permit any third party to make any use or disclosure of the Seller Console that is not expressly permitted under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you will not and will not permit any third party to:\r\n1.\tReverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discern the source code, algorithms, file formats, or interface protocols of the Seller Console or of any files contained in or generated by the Seller Console; \r\n2.\tCopy, modify, adapt, or translate the Seller Console; \r\n3.\tResell, distribute or sublicense the Seller Console, make the Seller Console available on a "service bureau" basis, or otherwise allow any third party to use or access the Seller Console; \r\n4.\tRemove or modify any proprietary marking or restrictive legends placed on the Seller Console; or \r\n5.\tUse the Seller Console in violation of any applicable law or regulation. \r\n\r\nAs between ParkWhiz and you, ParkWhiz retains title to and ownership of the Seller Console, including all copyrights and other intellectual property rights relating thereto. You will have no rights with respect to the Seller Console other than those expressly granted under this Agreement.\r\n\r\n**Fulfillment:** \r\nBy listing parking for booking on ParkWhiz, the Seller agrees to honor any parking sold. All information provided in the ParkWhiz listing must be accurate. If the Seller cannot fulfill the parking space or false information about the parking is provided, ParkWhiz will hold the Seller liable to reimburse the Buyer for their expense. If Seller continues to have issues with fulfillment ParkWhiz reserves the right to suspend or terminate Seller’s account until which time fulfillment is no longer an issue.\r\n**Note:** It is illegal to sell parking that you do not own or have the authority to sell, including but not limited to street parking. Any violations of this law will result in the immediate termination of your ParkWhiz account. ParkWhiz reserves the right to request proof of your ownership of parking or authority to sell parking in a particular location.\r\n\r\n**Payment:**\r\nParkWhiz guarantees payment to the Seller for all bookings fulfilled by the Seller minus the applicable ParkWhiz Fee. ParkWhiz, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge an additional processing charge to consumers for certain parking transactions, if applicable this amount will not be included in Seller\'s Payments. Payment will be issued in the form of a printed check or electronic bank transfer at the Seller\'s request which will be processed in no more than 10 business days.\r\n\r\n**Taxes:**\r\nYou accept exclusive responsibility for filing and paying all relevant and applicable local, state, and federal taxes. ParkWhiz shall have no obligation to collect or remit any taxes on your behalf. You shall indemnify ParkWhiz from and against any costs, claims, and other liability incurred as a result of your failure to comply with your obligations under this clause.\r\n\r\n**Contact Information:** \r\nThe Buyer’s name and contact information are provided to Sellers for the sole purpose of ensuring the parking booking is fulfilled and may not be used by the Seller for any other purpose. This information is to be considered confidential information belonging to ParkWhiz and is not be shared with any third party, for any reason without the prior written consent of ParkWhiz.\r\n\r\nSellers must submit a phone number for each parking location they list on ParkWhiz. Buyers will be provided with this number to call in the event of a problem with their parking. Buyers will be eligible for a refund at the Seller\'s expense if this number is not answered during the parking reservation period.\r\n\r\n**Making Adjustments:**\r\nSellers authorize us to withhold payment or charge their credit card account any amount owed to ParkWhiz if:\r\nA sale is canceled for any reason; An adjustment is made under our ParkWhiz Guarantee; Reasonably believe that a Seller has committed fraud or other illegal acts or omissions during any buying or selling activity, or Seller provides incorrect or misrepresented parking and/ or parking-related services for any booking or portion thereof.\r\n\r\n**ParkWhiz Fulfillment Dispute Resolution:** \r\nThe ParkWhiz Fulfillment Dispute Resolution strives to provide Buyers the protection and motivation to book their parking at ParkWhiz.com. Thus, we require Sellers to comply with our resolution process in case a Buyer files a claim that they did not receive parking. Sellers permit us to make a final decision, on any claim that a Buyer files with ParkWhiz under the policy. If we resolve a dispute in the Buyer\'s favor, we will refund the Buyer for the cost of the parking, and we will require the Seller to reimburse us for the refund. Any ParkWhiz fees for the booking will be refunded to the Seller. A warning notice will also be sent to the Seller.\r\n\r\nFor future claims where the Seller is found at fault after a warning has been issued, we will notify the Seller and continue to charge the Seller for any reimbursements made under the policy. In addition, we reserve the right to charge a $15 fee to cover chargebacks and other associated bank charges. ParkWhiz maintains the right to suspend or terminate a Seller\'s account if we suspect abuse or continuous account violations.\r\n\r\n**Grant of License:**\r\nYou grant ParkWhiz a perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free right to exercise publicity, database, trademark and copyright rights, including the right to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish and display on the Site and on the sites of our partners and affiliated companies, any content you may provide to ParkWhiz in connection with your use of ParkWhiz and its Services.

Make sure you’re using the same email address to log in as the one where you received that coupon! Also note the fine print of the promo - "book by" and "park by" requirements often apply.\n\n*Note that all discount codes will come from ParkWhiz directly. If you received your code from a third-party website, there\'s a significant chance it will not work. Unless specifically noted, discount codes cannot be used for monthly parking nor season pac*kages.\n\nIf you were issued ParkWhiz credit, the credit will automatically deduct from your total on the checkout page before your next purchase.

The vast majority of locations in our network accept a mobile pass, which means you can use your phone or other smart device to show proof of your prepaid purchase once you arrive at the parking facility.\n\nTo be sure, verify the validation method instructions on your pass. This section is titled "When You Arrive" in-app or "How To Park" if viewing on a desktop or mobile web. If your location does not accept mobile passes, you\'ll need to print the pass before leaving the house.\n\nFor a seamless, no-printer-required experience, check out the ParkWhiz app! Thousands of space at your fingertips. Rest assured that if searching and booking on a mobile device, we won\'t show you any locations that require a printed pass (at least not until cars come equipped with printers).',

            answer:

Also, oversize vehicles may be charged an additional fee, which may apply to any vehicle larger than a sedan. Fee amounts vary between individual Parking Operators, and will be assessed on-site if you do not prepay for an oversize vehicle through our platform.\n\nYou may also be charged a parking fee at check out.  At ParkWhiz we want to make parking easier and more convenient. While we understand no one likes to pay more, fees are necessary to continue to fund the improvements in parking convenience that we strive to provide.  \n\nAlthough pricing structures are determined individually by the facility owner/operator, ParkWhiz prices tend to be cheaper than drive-up in most cases! If you ever feel the rate on ParkWhiz was more expensive than drive-up, take a photo of the price on-site and send us an email! We love deals as much as you do and are eager to ensure you're getting a fair rate.",

                                          Normally I pay around $50 for parking
                                          in Chicago, but with ParkWhiz I was
                                          able to get a spot for $18 downtown.
                                          The price you see is the price you
                                          pay!
